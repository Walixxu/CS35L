  # find the files that have been edited 23 days ago
  find . -mtime 23
  find . -name 'play*'

  # will find all the files in the current directory and list the oldest one
  # at the bottom.
  ls -alt

  egrep, grep -E
  # regex expression has to be in single quotes
  egrep '#' [filename]

Users
================================================================================
  sudo useradd -d ~/ -m oracle
  sudo passwd oracle # 321

  # will turn on the setid bit
  chmod 4777 filename.sh

  # I added a group of users called guests
  sudo groupadd guests
  sudo groupdel guests

  # add the user oracle to the group of guests
  sudo usermod -G guests oracle
  # will turn on the guid bit
  # to delete the user from a group
  sudo gpasswd -d oracle guests
  chmod 2777 filename.txt

OpenSSH
================================================================================
	# Check if you even have OpenSSH
		dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	sudo apt-get install openssh-client

	# This will generate a key and save it to /home/drew/.ssh/id_rsa
	# There is no password on it
	ssh-keygen

	-d, --home-dir HOME_DIR
	The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value
	-for the user's login directory. The default is to append the LOGIN name to
	-BASE_DIR and use that as the login directory name. The directory HOME_DIR does
	-not have to exist but will not be created if it is missing.
  -the home directory will have a desktop.ini, Documents, Pictures, Music
    etc folders in it.
	A home directory has to be associated with the new user added.

  # Creates a key and saves it to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ssh-keygen

  # Make the new home directory for oracle. This will be the entry point for
  # oracle. The .ssh is needed for the passwordless login. That took me a while
  # to figure out.
    mkdir ~/Documents/oracle
    mkdir ~/Documents/oracle/.ssh


  # Create the user, and set its home directory.
    sudo useradd -d ~/Documents/oracle -m oracle

  # Create oracles password
    sudo passwd oracle

  # Now that oracle is a user, change the home directory to oracles. I have to do
  # this because when I'm logging in from the client for the first time, I'm going
  # to do the ssh-copy-id and I need the .ssh to be owned by oracle, otherwise
  # I'll get permission denied by the server.
    chown -R oracle ~/Documents/oracle
    chown -R oracle ~/Documents/oracle/.ssh

  # Remove password authentication. This is super dangerous and I don't like it
  # but whatever. PasswordAthentication no
    sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

  # Creates a key and saves it to ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ssh-keygen

  # This will copy my password 'keygen' to to ~/Documents/oracle/.ssh on the
  # server. I think...
    ssh-copy-id â€“i oracle@192.168.1.7

  # SSH into the server
    ssh -X oracle@192.168.1.7

  # Was not prompted for password. Then opened xterm.
    xterm

  # Note that this can only be done for ubuntu systems. I have a bash shell on my
  # windows 10 machine and X11 forwarding will not work


================================================================================
Diff and Patching
================================================================================
  # This will find the differences between a and b, where b is the 'newer' file
  # so when I make a patch, I patch atext so it looks like btext
  diff -u atext btext > patch

  # You have to save the differences is a file though because diff doesn't
  # do that for you.
  patch < patch
